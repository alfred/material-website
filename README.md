# Alfred Material
http://alfredabab.io

This is the repository for my portfolio website. It is not only a portfolio but also in itself a personal project. I wanted to make something that could showcase a little bit about what I've learned in the last year or so and I wanted to re-do the static site that I had up. 

It's created using [Google's Material Design](https://design.google.com/). I was always really impressed with the clean interactions and animations. I decided to read the Material Design spec to learn and see if I could build something like that because I usually just code. Using the [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) library I got to skip a lot of the legwork. 

Architecture-wise, I wanted/needed to host my past projects somewhere, because before this I just had two static pages of underwhelming content. I have every project that is hosted on here basically self-contained. It ends up being really easy to work with. Something I could do better would be to split up the SCSS files, maybe later. 

Lastly, I have never setup a build-management tool, everyone I've used has just been given to me, and I'd heard good things about gulp so decided to try it, actually painless.

Let me know what you think, definitely check it out on mobile if you get the chance. Also, this is probably really over-engineered. But it's beautiful in its own way.
