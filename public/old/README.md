# Shove Resume somewhere #

My current idea now, is to have a consistent cropped navbar on the top. It will be a flat bar, and will hopefully be a  deeper sky blue. I can use the color picker for this. Each with a Title in it, that when you scroll to that section is highlighted and this is done while scrolling and instantly, that means I have to put them in order. hopefully.

Introduction - "Hi! I'm Alfred", (work on the introduction)
Northeastern University, Boston, MA
Short blurb about me, play it casual. Like: I like DC Comics, Programming, Learning just about anything.
Make this background the blurry silkweave thing, you still have it in the Pictures folder

About - "A Little About Myself" Page long about me kinda thing.

Projects - "Things I've Worked On" List of projects, each with a summary 
Use columns until it grows then make it carosel.. or showcase style, like Beatrice? but not gross?

Contact Me - "Internet Identity" Links to showcase myself, should probably leave the shameful accounts off this
* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Gmail
* GitHub
* Steam Account?

# TO DOS #
* Completely re-do navbar from scratch, bootstrap letting me down
* Projects line should comfortable fit 3 on my screen before pushing one down wtf
* Get icons to actually resize would be nice
* Give page items background colors
* Choose font and font colors for page items
* Add icons for WMDs
** Make WMDs have static backgrounds and then on hover change to color that matches icon
